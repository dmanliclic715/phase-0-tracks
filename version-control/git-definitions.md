# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to keep track of different versions of code of the same file. It allows for a more productive workflow for a software production team.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is your own experimental version of a file. You can use it to edit a project without editing the primary or master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point for the file you're working on. A good commit message is using present tense and it outlines what was done in the particular file.
* What is a merge conflict?
It is when two people change the same line of code and git cannot tell which one is correct.
