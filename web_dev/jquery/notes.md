# JQuery Plan
1. Since I don't know much about jquery the first thing I'm going to do is google it and find as many resources as I can on the javascript library.
2. Once I have a substantial amount of knowledge about the tool, I'll start to experiment with it by coding certain commands to see what I can accomplish.
3. I'll then devise a way in which I can incoporate jquery into a project that I have in mind.
